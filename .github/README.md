> These scripts are meant exclusively for my own setup and opinionated view on
how to maintain my own system. They may not work well (or at all) for your own
system. Needless to say, they're made for Arch Linux only.

# Motivation
I'm extremely lazy and if nobody pointed out the fact that I haven't updated my
system for the last 7 months, I probably wouldn't. This initially motivated me
to make a script that would remind me to update on occasion, but as I went, I
made more scripts to automate some other tasks.

Not all scripts in this repository are sysadmin-oriented, though.

# Organization
So far, there are 2 clearly differentiated directories:
- `fluff` contains scripts that are mainly just for show, like a shell greeter
and a fetch script.
- `pkg-mngmt` contains scripts that automate some update-related tasks to a safe
degree.

# Other distros
While these scripts are made for Arch Linux, you could easily adapt some of them
to your own use-case in your distribution of choice.
